# 🚲 Bike Sales Analysis 

## Description
This project analyzes bike sales data using Power BI, leveraging Power Query, DAX, and interactive dashboards.
The goal of the project is to explore sales performance, product trends, customer behavior, and employee contribution across all stores.

The Power BI report consists of two pages:
- Overview — overall sales, product, and store performance
- Staff Performance — detailed employee-level sales insights

The dashboard provides insights such as:
- Total revenue and profit analysis
- Sales by store, category, and brand
- Top-performing and low-performing products
- Monthly performance trends
- Discount impact on revenue
- Staff sales comparison and ranking
