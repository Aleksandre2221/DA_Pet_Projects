# 📚 Library Management System 

## Description
This project focuses on performing **data operations, analysis, and reporting** on a Library Management System using SQL.  
The goal is to handle real-world tasks such as managing books, members, employees, branching, and analyzing book issue/return workflows.

## Case Study Questions
The analysis answers key business questions, including:

- Creating, updating, and deleting library records  
- Tracking issued, returned, and overdue books  
- Listing active members and recent registrations  
- Identifying top-performing employees  
- Generating branch performance reports  
- Calculating rental revenue by category  
- Detecting books not yet returned  

## Findings
- **Book Activity:** Several books are frequently issued, allowing identification of high-demand titles.  
- **Employee Performance:** Some employees process significantly more book issues than others.  
- **Branch Insights:** Branches show measurable differences in total issued books and rental revenue.  
- **Overdue Tracking:** A clear method identifies overdue books and members responsible.  
- **Member Engagement:** Active members can be tracked using issue history and time windows.
