6. How many orders were placed by customers who live in a different state than the store?
7. What is the average number of products per order?
8. What is the quarterly sales growth rate for each store?
9. Which salespeople achieved at least 90% of their target?
10. Which customers purchased products from at least 4 different categories?
11. What are the 3 brands with the highest average revenue per order?
12. Calculate customer retention month by month.
13. What is the average number of days between two consecutive purchases per customer?
14. For each category, what percentage of products were sold out of the total inventory?
15. What is the average order value per state?
16. Which salespeople sold products only in certain months of the year?
17. What is the average number of orders handled per salesperson?
