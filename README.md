# Data Analytics Pet Projects
In this repository, I will be putting all of my pet projects for each tool, starting from the very first ones. They won’t be perfect - some are unfinished, some contain mistakes, and in the earlier ones the approaches might be poor - but i intentionally keep as they are, because they perfectly represent my learning journey. You can clearly see how my skills improved with each new project.

P.S. The project upload date on GitHub does not match the actual creation date. Many projects - especially the early ones - were created long before I posted them here on GitHub.
